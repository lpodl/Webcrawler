# WebCrawler

## What it does

Starting from a given url, the Crawler will:

1. Scrape the current website for links (including images)
2. Add all new links to its queue (excluding anything but http and https)
3. Visit the next site in line
4. Continue with step 1 until there are no pages left to visit or a maximum view count is exceeded

This repository includes a setup to test for broken links on a website with Mocha.js.
